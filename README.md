# ✨ Sigil Weaver

Sigil Weaver is a simple browser-based tool to transform your intention, spell, or phrase into a **unique magical sigil**.  
It offers **two different generation methods**:
1. **Alphabet Circle Method** – Places the alphabet (A–Z) around a circle and connects the letters of your phrase into a sigil.
2. **Number Circle Method** – Places the numbers 1–9 around a circle and converts each letter of your phrase into numbers (based on numerology).  
   - If a number appears **multiple times**, it is **circled** in the final sigil design to highlight its repetition.
